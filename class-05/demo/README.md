# Demo: CSS and Color

## Demo Instructions

Review the lab. Students will be styling their own pages.

Start with a wireframe of the site you built in the last class. Let the class decide how to color it, using a color scheme from https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel.

Let the class set the priorities for what you implement. With them driving, style up your page. Don't hesitate to progress towards working quickly to give them an example of what full-speed dev work might look like.
